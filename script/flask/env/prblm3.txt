zero production:
no generation will happen using zero prodeuction.

atmost one production:
the generations will be-{wcdS, bLe , s}.
in this only one string has all terminal symbol so that the set of terminal string we can generate is {s}.

atmost two production:
the generations will be-{wcdS, bLe, s, wdcbLe, wcds, bSe, bL:S, wcdwcdS}.
set of terminal strings-{wcds, s}.

at most three production:
set of terminal strings -{wcds, s, wcdwcds, bse}.
